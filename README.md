# Image-classification-Using-ML

In this project our task is to classify images of Pokémon Ditto, butter free and Pikachu by implementing various machine 
leaning and deep learning algorithms. We used traditional recognitional model and extracted some human crafted features 
then trained dataset with various algorithms. We tried various experiments to improve our performance on the dataset to 
get the best prediction score and accuracy score for dataset.


The input for this task is images of Ditto, Butter free and Pikachu, while the output is classification accuracy on the 
dataset. Dataset consist of 66 images of butter free, 59 images of Ditto and 198 images of Pikachu. Size of image of these
Pokémon were quite distributed so appropriate preprocessing was done to scale them to a similar level.
