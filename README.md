# Image-classification-Using-ML

In this project our task is to classify images of Pok√©mon Ditto, butter free and Pikachu by implementing various machine 
leaning and deep learning algorithms. We used traditional recognitional model and extracted some human crafted features 
then trained dataset with various algorithms. We tried various experiments to improve our performance on the dataset to 
get the best prediction score and accuracy score for dataset.
